The credit utilization ratio is the amount of credit you use from the total credit limit you have. Experts advise that you keep your credit utilization at 30% to ensure a good credit score.
3) Credit Mix
Having multiple credit accounts, such as a home loan, personal loan, and credit card show lenders that you can manage multiple types of debt at the same time. The more credit types you have, the better (as long as you pay on time).
4) Multiple enquiries on your credit
If your credit report shows a lot of hard enquiries in the recent past, it will have a negative effect on your credit score. Multiple hard enquiries mean that you are desperate for credit, which makes you a bad risk.
